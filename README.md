# Employee-Salary-Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a person's income exceeds $50K/year using structured demographic data. It follows a complete Machine Learning pipeline, including:

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions, correlations, and insights.

🧠 Feature Engineering: Creating new meaningful features like capital_diff, edu_level, age_group, and is_family_person from existing ones.

🤖 Model Training: Using powerful ML models like CatBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest to train on cleaned data.

🧪 Evaluation: Comparing model performances based on accuracy.

🖥️ Deployment: Building a user-friendly Streamlit interface that takes user inputs for all model-required features and predicts income class.
